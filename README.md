# Used Car Prediction Model
 Due to demand and supply induced shortage, average car prices of used cars have 
soared significantly in the US over the past year. In this project , we have data 
derived from the Used Car Prediction Dataset on Kaggle that will be employed to 
predict the price of used cars. The model can eventually be used by car dealerships 
and online car vendors to predict used car prices. Moreover, it will provide us the 
ability to research and understand key factors that have a significant impact on 
used car prices

In this project, I aim to:
- Explain the problem statement and business case
- Import libraries/datasets and perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform Data Visualization 
- Prepare the data before model training
- Train and Evaluate a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Train and Evaluate a Decision Tree , Random Forest & XG Boost Model
- Compare models and calculate Regression KPIs
- Present Findings And Key Findings On Tableau
